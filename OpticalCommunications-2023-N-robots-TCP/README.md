Optical wireless communication (OWC) can enable much higher data rates (tens of Gbps) compared to traditional
radio frequency or RF-based wirelesstechnologies. A highly useful feature of OWC is its inherentsignalsecurity and
it can also provide connectivity in unfavorable conditions, e.g., presence of RF jamming or interception. Hence,
equipping military robots like PackBots [1] with OWC-enabled transceivers is a potential application area for OWC.
Despite the advantages, the high directionality ofsuch transceivers makesOWC vulnerable to mobility and requires
discovery and maintenance of line-of-sight (LOS) alignment between the transceivers.
In this project, the students will design and develop a multi-transceiver OWC communication module. Mobile robot
cars will be equipped with these OWC modules. The students will also develop protocols for LOS maintenance
between these cars to establish communication links and transfer data. The multi-transceiver OWC module will
not only help in maintaining LOS alignment but can also enable simultaneous communication with multiple robot
cars.




Github Branch Policies (main):
------------------------------

1.) All commits/merges made to the main branch must go through a pull request, and the pull request must be approved by at least one other person. 

2.) If new changes are made to a pull request, all previous approvals will be reset. This is done so that new changes are forced to go through the approval process.

3.) Any conversations on a pull request must be resolved before the pull request will be merged into main.
